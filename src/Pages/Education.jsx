          <p>
          I have graduated from <span className="highlight1">Kennesaw State University</span> with a Master's degree in<span className="highlight1"> Information Technology</span>. Throughout my studies, I had the opportunity
            to work on different projects related to<span className="highlight1"> Software Development</span> and <span className="highlight1">Machine Learning</span>. I learned how
            to build full-stack appliactions and machine learning models to solve real-world problems. 
          I have successfully delivered projects like a <span className="highlight1">GTA Hiring & Management System</span>, enhancing workflows and user interfaces. 
          My strength lies in creating visually appealing, responsive designs 
          and ensuring seamless interaction between the <span className="highlight1">frontend and backend</span>, turning ideas into impactful solutions.
          </p>
          <p>
          My journey wasnâ€™t just about learning technical skills, it also helped me grow as a problem solver and a creative thinker.
           I enjoy tackling challenges and designing user-friendly applications.
